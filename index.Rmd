##Uses for the app
This shiny app uses the [earthquake database](https://www.kaggle.com/usgs/earthquake-database) from kaggle.com to show where earthquakes occur. I limited the database to 2000-2016 to help it run a little smoother. The app can be used for the following:

- Look in trends in earthquakes.
- See the lines that quakes occur on.
- Look at when quakes happen in specific places.
 

##slide 3
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(magrittr)
earth <- read.csv("database.csv")
tmp <- as.Date(earth$Date, "%m/%d/%Y") %>% format("%Y") %>% as.numeric()
earth$year <- tmp
rm(tmp)
earth <- earth[!is.na(earth$year) & !is.na(earth$Longitude) & !is.na(earth$Latitude),]
earth <- earth[earth$year >= 2000,]
```
```{r}
hist(earth$year, breaks = 16)
```

##slide 4
```{r}
hist(earth$Magnitude, breaks = 10)
```
